# SAT Solver Toolkit

This project provides a suite of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers and a benchmarking utility. It includes implementations of the Resolution, Davis-Putnam (DP), and DPLL algorithms, as well as tools for generating SAT problem instances and running benchmarks.

## Features

* **Resolution Solver**
* **Davis-Putnam (DP) Solver**
* **DPLL Solver** with multiple variable selection heuristics:

  * Random
  * Jeroslow-Wang (JW)
  * Maximum Occurrence in Minimum Size Clause (MOM)
* **DIMACS CNF parser**
* **CNF Instance Generator** (Random 3-SAT and Pigeonhole Principle)
* **Benchmark Runner** with CSV logging and timeout control

## Structure

* `sat_solver.py`: Main script to run solvers.
* `benchmark_runner.py`: Script to generate CNF instances and benchmark solver performance.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `pandas`, `tqdm` (install via `pip install pandas tqdm`)

## Usage

### Running the SAT Solver

```bash
python3 sat_solver.py <cnf_file> [-a ALGORITHM] [-H HEURISTIC] [-v]
```

**Arguments:**

* `<cnf_file>`: Path to a DIMACS CNF file.
* `-a`, `--algorithm`: SAT solver algorithm to use (`resolution`, `dp`, `dpll`). Default is `dpll`.
* `-H`, `--heuristic`: Heuristic to use with DPLL (`random`, `jw`, `mom`). Default is `mom`.
* `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable verbose output.

**Example:**

```bash
python3 sat_solver.py benchmarks/random_20vars.cnf -a dpll -H jw -v
```

### Generating CNF Instances and Benchmarking

```bash
python3 benchmark_runner.py
```

You will be prompted to:

* Set timeouts for each algorithm
* Generate new CNF files
* Select which algorithms to benchmark

Benchmarks will be run and results logged to a CSV file if enabled in the code.

## File Formats

### DIMACS CNF Format

```
c Example comment
p cnf <num_vars> <num_clauses>
<lit1> <lit2> ... <litN> 0
...
```

### CNF Generators

* `generate_random_3sat_instance(num_vars, num_clauses, filename)`
* `generate_pigeonhole_instance(n, filename)`

## Notes

* Pigeonhole problems are known to be hard for Resolution and DP.
* Resolution and DP may be impractical for large instances.

This toolkit was developed as an educational SAT solver project.
